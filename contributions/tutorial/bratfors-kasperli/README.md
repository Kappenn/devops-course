## Description
A tutorial that teaches the reader how to install and setup TeamCity from scratch for a gradle project on GitHub. The tutorial will have some screen captures and should be easy to understand for anyone with experience in GitHub, but not necessarily with continuous integration.

## Submission
The tutorial is posted on:

https://github.com/Kappenn/TeamCity_Tutorial

We have a fun fact in the background section and also an easter egg if one chooses to use the provided repo for the tutorial.

## Repeat:

We have expanded the background to explain about how CI and automated build tools are connected to Devops.

We have added instructions to install Java 8 and Gradle, either from the respective website or through a package manager.
